= Markup View API

All Markup views subclass the link:api/grails/plugin/markup/view/MarkupViewTemplate.html[MarkupViewTemplate] class by default.

The `MarkupViewTemplate` superclass implements the link:api/grails/plugin/markup/view/api/MarkupView.html[MarkupView] trait which in turn extends the the link:api/grails/views/api/GrailsView.html[GrailsView] trait.

Much of the API is shared between JSON and Markup views. However, one difference compared to JSON views is that you must use `this` as a prefix when refering to properties from the parent class. For example to generate links this will produce a compilation error:

[source,groovy]
cars {
   cars.each {
       car(make: it.make, href: g.link(controller:'car'))
   }
}

However, the following works fine:

[source,groovy]
cars {
   cars.each {
       car(make: it.make, href: this.g.link(controller:'car'))
   }
}

Notice the `this` prefix when refering to `this.g.link(..)`.
