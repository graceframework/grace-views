= Introduction

The Grails Views project provides additional view technologies to the Grails framework, including JSON and Markup views.

JSON views allow rendering of JSON responses using Groovy's http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/gapi/groovy/json/StreamingJsonBuilder.html[StreamingJsonBuilder].
