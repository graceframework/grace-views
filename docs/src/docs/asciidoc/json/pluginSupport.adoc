= Plugin Support

Grails plugins as well as standard Gradle Java/Groovy projects can provide json views to your application.

== Grails Plugins

Since JSON views are compiled all of a plugin's views and templates are available for use in your applications.

The view resolution will look through all of the application's configured plugins for views that match a particular name. By default, the views a plugin supplies should be stored in `grails-app/views`, just like applications.

== Basic Libraries

The most common use case to provide views in a standard library is to provide global templates. Global templates are templates designed to render a given class as JSON. In order to provide views in a standard Gradle project, you should configure your own view compilation task.

Below is an example Gradle build that adds a `compileViews` task for templates located into `src/main/gson`:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://repo.grails.org/grails/core" }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "org.grails.plugins:views-gradle:{version}"
    }
}

import grails.views.gradle.json.*

apply plugin:"java"

repositories {
    maven { url "https://repo.grails.org/grails/core" }
}

dependencies {
    compile "org.grails.plugins:views-json:{version}"
    compileOnly "org.grails:grails-plugin-rest:3.1.7"
    compileOnly "javax.servlet:javax.servlet-api:4.0.1"
}

task( compileViews, type:JsonViewCompilerTask ) {
    source = project.file('src/main/gson')
    destinationDir = project.file('build/classes/main')
    packageName = ""
    classpath = configurations.compileClasspath + configurations.runtimeClasspath
}
classes.dependsOn compileViews
----

Once this is in place any applications that includes this library will have access to the templates provided.

For example if you want to render all instances of type `foo.bar.Birthday` create a template called `src/main/gson/foo/bar/_birthday.gson` then compile the template and place the JAR on the classpath of your application.

NOTE: See the https://github.com/grails/grails-views/tree/master/json-templates/src/templates/grails/mongodb/geo[GeoJSON templates] for MongoDB for example of how it provides global templates for Mongo specific classes.

== Customizing the Compile Task

Unless otherwise configured, the project name of the plugin (the gradle `project.name`) is used as the `packageName` when compiling JSON views.


In Gradle `project.name` is generally calculated from the current directory. That means that if there is mismatch between the current directory and your plugin name view resolution from a plugin could fail.

For example consider a plugin named `FooBarGrailsPlugin`, in this case Grails will search for views that match the plugin name `foo-bar`. However, if the directory where the plugin is located is called `fooBar` instead of `foo-bar` then view resolution will fail and the view will not be found when the plugin is installed into an application.

To resolve this issue you can customize the `compileGsonViews` task in the plugin's `build.gradle`

[source,groovy]
----
compileGsonViews {
    packageName = "foo-bar"
}
----

By setting the `packageName` property to correctly match the convention of the plugin named (`FooBarGrailsPlugin` maps to `foo-bar`) view resolution will succeed.
