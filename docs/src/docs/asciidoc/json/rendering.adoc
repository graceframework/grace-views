= Rendering Domain Classes

== Basics of Domain Class Rendering

Typically your model may involve one or many domain instances. JSON views provide a `render` method for rendering these.
  
For example given the following domain class:

[source,groovy]
class Book {
    String title
}
    
And the following template: 
 
[source,groovy]
model {
    Book book
}    
json g.render(book) 

The resulting output is:

[source,javascript]
{"id":1,"title":"The Stand"}
    
You can customize the rendering by including or excluding properties:
    
[source,groovy]    
json g.render(book, [includes:['title']])
    
Or by providing a closure to provide additional JSON output:
    
[source,groovy]    
json g.render(book) {
    pages 1000
}  

Or combine the two approaches:

[source,groovy]    
json g.render(book, [includes:['title']]) {
    pages 1000
}

== Deep Rendering of Domain Classes

Typically the `g.render(..)` method will only render objects one level deep. In other words if you have a domain class such as:

[source,groovy]
class Book {
    String title
    Author author
}

The resulting output will be something like:

[source,javascript]
{"id":1,"title":"The Stand","author":{id:1}}

If you wish for the `author` to be included as part of the rendering, there are two requirements, first you must make sure the association is initialized.

If the `render` method encounters a proxy, it will not traverse into the relationship to avoid N+1 query performance problems.

NOTE: The same applies to one-to-many collection associations. If the association has not been initialized the `render` method will not traverse through the collection!

So you must make sure your query uses a join:

[source,groovy]
Book.findByTitle("The Stand", [fetch:[author:"join"]])

Secondly when calling the `render` method you should pass the `deep` argument:

[source,groovy]
json g.render(book, [deep:true])

Alternatively, to only expand a single association you can use the `expand` argument:

[source,groovy]
json g.render(book, [expand:['author']])

NOTE: request parameters can also be used to expand associations (eg. `?expand=author`), if you do not want to allow this, then use `includes` or `excludes` to include only the properties you want.

Finally, if you prefer to handle the rendering yourself you can do by excluding the property:

[source,groovy]
json g.render(book, [excludes:['author']]) {
    author {
        name book.author.name
    }
}

== Domain Class Rendering and Templates

An alternative to the default behaviour of the `render` method is to rely on templates.

In other words if you create a `/author/_author.gson` template and then use the `g.render` method on an instance of `book`:

[source,groovy]
json g.render(book)

Whenever the `author` association is encountered the `g.render` method will automatically render the `/author/_author.gson` template instead.
